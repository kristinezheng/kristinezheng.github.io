# Pleasure of Looking 

1. [Observing, capturing, and creating](#observing-capturing-and-creating)

## Observing, capturing, and creating
I like to look.

I like to imagine the worlds that good stories build, painted in slowly. 

I like to look at physical objects (e.g. pottery and furniture) the most at art museums. 

I like to go to supermarkets and street markets, especially in new places. 

I like to look at plants very closely, seeing their flowers, stems, leaves, and more. 

This pleasure in looking isn't the same as the one thought of as the male or female gaze [(Mulvey 1975)](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1021/Laura%20Mulvey%2C%20Visual%20Pleasure.pdf).
