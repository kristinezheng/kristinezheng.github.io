## Explorable explanations 
[EDUC 432: DESIGNING EXPLORABLE EXPLANATIONS FOR LEARNING](https://educ432.subramonyam.com/) -- winter 2025, Hari Subramonyam

Relevant readings:
* [Brett Victor: Explorable Explanations](https://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/)


Notes:
* *Explorable Explanations:* Active reading and learning, sometimes with visualizations, interactive simulations, etc. It can be more costly to create learning material & may or may not have the intended effect. 
* are simulations **fun** and why? mental/literal -- also iterations, experimentation (science of science) (PhET)
    * simulation for learning: simulation model of learning through simulations???
* Play:
    *  [Seriously considering play: Designing interactive learning environments based on the blending of microworlds, simulations, and games](springer)
    * How do good game designers manage to get new players to learn long,
complex, and difficult games? [**Learning by Design: good video games as learning machines**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvWoHlH6_RyDMdCKOtpqeKbVsTwueAL-/view) -- empowered learners (co-creation, customize), problem solving (well-scoped, challengng with feedback), understanding
        * optimal information presentation (timing, mode, etc)
        * how can skills translate to application/strategies 
        * side note: learning to type in the context of tech/scifi "missions" was sort of fun 
* ["How can we help educators choose environments best suited for their needs, and inform designers to develop effective environments?"](https://link-springer-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1007/s10956-017-9719-8)
* [constructivism theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) -- learners *construct* learning through experiences/social interactions as well as instruction (active learning in a sense)

## mechanistic models
[mechanistic explanation](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/vgigt1aq/release/1)
* 2 kinds: (1) etiology/history of how things came to be, (2) the components/organization of the current system 
* key concepts:
    * casuation
        * description/prediction does not mean explanation of a phenomena (does not give the why or how necessarily)
    * (de)composition
        * cognitive capacity can be iteratively decomposed into "lower-level" capacities (statistical literacy -> visual reasoning -> perception -> etc)
        * constitutive explanations are multi-level --> explanations describes subparts of a phenonena and their organization
    * organization
        * the organization of subcomponents matter and they may not have linear/interchangeable relationships
        * involves spatial, temporal, and casual relations
