## CogSci 2025

### DSP/SOLDS
* DSP Background: Data science pathways (DSP) started a few years ago at UCSD with E.B., H.L., and other members of the lab. The goal is to analyze longitudinal student data from an online data science/statistics learning platform, [CourseKata (CK)](https://coursekata.org/), to find out what factors influence student learning. CK includes interactive learning activities (quizzes, open response, code boxes, multiple choice questions) and surveys (assessing mindset, beliefs, attitudes throughout the course). The platform collects data in the form of activity responses and engagement traces (timestamps of when an action is taken or something is completed). 
* SOLDS Background: In Fall 2024, J.F. and I developed a mindset intervention pilot experiment to run in an intro course that quarter. In addition to the material presented and data collected by CK, we also administered pre-course & mid-course surveys, mindset intervention module (embedded in CK), and interactive p-value lab activity. The intervention had two versions: stress-reframing/strategic mindset intervention, neuro-mechanistic control activity. 
* Process: The analysis was quite complicated (imo) for both datasets. DSP used all 2023 course data (1000+ students, ~40 classrooms) and included multiple textbook versions with slight variation. SOLDS also included two qualtrics surveys (including additional survey items in a different format) and Canvas course data. Both datasets required a lot of preprocessing and merging. The survey item responses were formatted in an unintuitive way (sometimes hard to figure out which question it corresponded to) and we hand assigned *constructs* to group the items (sort of based on ck but sort of not). Our goal was to find the relationship between the survey constructs, between the constructs and engagement, and between the constructs, engagement, and learning. We operationalized engagement in two ways: (1) the proportion of pages a student completed in a chapter/out of the textbook as compared the all the pages anyone in their class completed; (2) the (z-score) average page completion rate. There really wasn't a relationship between engagement with constructs or engagement with learning, surprisingly(?). I ended up spending almost the entirety of January trying various analyses and modeling. It was hard for me to tell if the relationships just weren't there, if the measurement methods were unable discern the relationships, or if the analysis had errors... I'm pretty sure the data was just very noisy though. Saturday night before the deadline, I finally finished making all the figures in illustrator (I understand the hype! it is quite fun) and somehow managed to write a draft before Sunday morning. This sort of academic writing is fairly formulaic but I had a hard time starting the process and kept procrastinating ... Thankfully, J.F. and E.B. were able to answer some questions and do some editing and it was submitted at a very reasonable time.
* Reflection: I do feel like I learned *a lot* from the entire process and it is very empowering to know that I am capable of writing? sort of? The results don't feel quite satisfying though but I do understand this project is very much in progress (the point of CogSci anyways!). I am sort of stressed out by the state of my code repo which started out reasonably organized but soon became bloated with terrible version control and exploratory analyses. 

### Fun Puzzles (Sokoban)
* Background *(more to come)*: What makes a game fun? What makes a game difficult? What is the relationship between difficulty and fun? Why do some games become extremely popular while others are soon forgotten? J.C. had been developing this project for a while before I joined. We used the puzzle game [Sokoban](http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), a grid world game that classically involves guiding a character to push boxes to goals (many-to-many problem). 
* Process: This project involved two parts: (1) *[gleaning](./3_02-16-2025.md#gleaning)* puzzle data from the popular website, [sokobanonline.com](https://www.sokobanonline.com/); (2) running more targeted experiments on prolific. I was mainly tasked the with gleaning aka webscraping portion. It was honestly mostly quite enjoyable,  sort of a puzzle game itself, to iteratively figure out how to borrow large amounts of information from a website. We collected information on puzzle layout (see example below), # likes/dislikes, # plays, shortest solutions, etc. Later, we also ran the [a* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) on the puzzles (mostly ones with > 200 plays) to find the shortest length solution. Ultimately, this gave us solution-based and visual puzzle features to compare with reactions. 
* Reflection: I really enjoyed this project! It was a lot of fun to build/glean a dataset and carefully select relevant information. Game-based cogsci research is often conducted with online experiments and doesn't necessarily incorporate real-world data so it was really cool to have both here. I was able to use some of the methods I learned from the [DSP/SOLDS](./2_02-16-2025.md#dspsolds) project here. There is *a lot* more that can be done (other features like dead zones, modern puzzles with portals, human puzzle solving traces) and we have barely scratched the surface. Perhaps I wasn't quite as stressed from this project because someone else did all the hard thinking and planning ... 

Sample puzzle layout [(alberto garcia: collection 1-1, #15)](https://www.sokobanonline.com/play/web-archive/alberto-garcia/1-1/3387_1-1-15): "#" are walls, "$" are boxes, "." are goals, and "@" is the character's position. 
```
[
    "###   #####",
    "# #####   #",
    "#    #  #@#",
    "#  $     ##",
    "##$ #.  ##",
    "#  $## .#",
    "##.  # ##",
    " ##    #",
    "  ######"
  ]
```

### General thoughts:
*coming soon!*

## Ed. Research 

Why are games fun? Why is studying games fun? 

Ed Cons: not as gratifying in some way (longitudinal, less control, limited (bc of research of what matters (STEM))), don’t want to be an educational researcher (bc little foothold in the cogsci or even neuro field), cleaner data/modeling pipelines 

The problem really isn't with the research but with myself. 

## research existential crises
What do I actually care about?
* The science more than the application (which is still important)
* Something visual & sort of design/creative (maybe there is a way to make math games fun)
* highly engineered models to “turn the knobs” as E.B. would say → know very clearly how things are done and how processes relate
