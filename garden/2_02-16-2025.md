## CogSci 2025

### DSP/SOLDS
* DSP Background: Data science pathways (DSP) started a few years ago with E.B., H.L., and other members of the lab. The goal is to analyze longitudinal student data from an online data science/statistics learning platform, [CourseKata (CK)](https://coursekata.org/), to find out what factors influence student learning. CK includes interactive learning activities (quizzes, open response, code boxes, multiple choice questions) and surveys (assessing mindset, beliefs, attitudes throughout the course). The platform collects data in the form of activity responses and engagement traces (timestamps of when an action is taken or something is completed). 
* SOLDS Background: In Fall 2024, J.F. and I developed a mindset intervention pilot experiment to run in an intro course that quarter. In addition to the material presented and data collected by CK, we also administered pre-course & mid-course surveys, mindset intervention module (embedded in CK), and interactive p-value lab activity. The intervention had two versions: stress-reframing/strategic mindset intervention, neuro-mechanistic control activity. 
* Process: The analysis was quite complicated (imo) for both datasets. DSP used all 2023 course data (1000+ students, ~40 classrooms) and included multiple textbook versions with slight variation. SOLDS also included two qualtrics surveys (including additional survey items in a different format) and Canvas course data. Both datasets required a lot of preprocessing and merging. The survey item responses were formatted in an unintuitive way (sometimes hard to figure out which question it corresponded to) and we hand assigned *constructs* to group the items (sort of based on ck but sort of not). Our goal was to find the relationship between the survey constructs, between the constructs and engagement, and between the constructs, engagement, and learning. We operationalized engagement in two ways: (1) the proportion of pages a student completed in a chapter/out of the textbook as compared the all the pages anyone in their class completed; (2) the (z-score) average page completion rate. There really wasn't a relationship between engagement with constructs or engagement with learning, surprisingly(?). I ended up spending almost the entirety of January trying various analyses and modeling. It was hard for me to tell if the relationships just weren't there, if the measurement methods were unable discern the relationships, or if the analysis had errors... I'm pretty sure the data was just very noisy though. Saturday night before the deadline, I finally finished making all the figures in illustrator (I understand the hype! it is quite fun) and somehow managed to write a draft before Sunday morning. This sort of academic writing is fairly formulaic but I had a hard time starting the process and kept procrastinating ... Thankfully, J.F. and E.B. were able to answer some questions and do some editing and it was submitted at a very reasonable time.
* Reflection: I do feel like I learned *a lot* from the entire process and it is very empowering to know that I am capable of writing? sort of? The results don't feel quite satisfying though but I do understand this project is very much in progress (the point of CogSci anyways!). I am sort of stressed out by the state of my code repo which started out reasonably organized but soon became bloated with terrible version control and exploratory analyses. 

### Fun Puzzles (Sokoban)
* Background *(more to come)*: What makes a game fun? What makes a game difficult? What is the relationship between difficulty and fun? Why do some games become extremely popular while others are soon forgotten? J.C. had been developing this project for a while before I joined. We used the puzzle game [Sokoban](http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), a grid world game that classically involves guiding a character to push boxes to goals (many-to-many problem). 
* Process: This project involved two parts: (1) *[gleaning](./3_02-16-2025.md#gleaning)* puzzle data from the popular website, [sokobanonline.com](https://www.sokobanonline.com/); (2) running more targeted experiments on prolific. I was mainly tasked the with gleaning aka webscraping portion. It was honestly mostly quite enjoyable,  sort of a puzzle game itself, to iteratively figure out how to borrow large amounts of information from a website. We collected information on puzzle layout (see example below), # likes/dislikes, # plays, shortest solutions, etc. Later, we also ran the [a* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) on the puzzles (mostly ones with > 200 plays) to find the shortest length solution. Ultimately, this gave us solution-based and visual puzzle features to compare with reactions. 
* Reflection: I really enjoyed this project! It was a lot of fun to build/glean a dataset and carefully select relevant information. Game-based cogsci research is often conducted with online experiments and doesn't necessarily incorporate real-world data so it was really cool to have both here. I was able to use some of the methods I learned from the [DSP/SOLDS](./2_02-16-2025.md#dspsolds) project here. There is *a lot* more that can be done (other features like dead zones, modern puzzles with portals, human puzzle solving traces) and we have barely scratched the surface. Perhaps I wasn't quite as stressed from this project because someone else did all the hard thinking and planning ... 

Sample puzzle layout [(alberto garcia: collection 1-1, #15)](https://www.sokobanonline.com/play/web-archive/alberto-garcia/1-1/3387_1-1-15): "#" are walls, "$" are boxes, "." are goals, and "@" is the character's position.

<!-- ### General thoughts:
*coming soon!*

Why are games fun? Why is studying games fun? 

## Ed. Research 

Education research (perhaps more like psychology/cognitive science as applied to real world educational contexts) is incredibly important for our communities and for science. Clearly not all students do "well" in school or on standardized assessments (designed probably to be easy to grade rather than to be optimal measurements of learning). Many students, in fact, dread school, learning, math, science, etc. -- this might be due to negative past experiences, beliefs about themselves, and feelings about the school environment & materials. On the other hand, in psychology/cognitive science, we study learning but typically in short timescale, controlled settings. For example, people might be tested on learning vocabulary or math problems in 1-2 hour sessions or over the course of a few weeks (TODO cite ...). Can we really understand human learningd and development if we don't take into consideration formal curriculums, instruction, and school? Can "intuitive" theories of psychology and physics be separated from the influence of social interactions and learning in school? Students probably learn about social norms and gravity... Why is education research and development so divided from cognitive/psych research anyways? One short answer: it is difficult!!

The challenges of educational research (probably agreed upon by most): in-person/classroom studies tend to require much longer duration with less control. [Heterogeneous Effects in Education](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0091732X18759040) can make it impossible to measure and know every factor that impacts learning (lots of variation in identity, background, environments, etc). In contrast, "traditional" lab experiments can be iterated on much faster (especially online studies) and different components can be relatively modeled in detail. With online learning platforms (CK, [Edx](https://www.edx.org/), etc), it is much easier to collect longitudinal data with detailed process traces and implment different experiment versions. However, the beauty and issue could still be that this work is on real students and can truly impact their lives: this work is meant to be long-term because school/learning takes years. 

How do I feel about this? I feel a bit mixed: on one hand, it is amazing to be able to apply research to real-world application so quickly; on the other hand, this work requires a lot of commitment and time (less immediate gratification...). The real-world data is also much more complicated and noisy -- harder to interpret and takes many studies to build theories. More personally, I am not yet perceived as a "real" cognitive scientist and this research area isn't too mainstream yet (perhaps my world is too small but I don't want to be pigeonholed here). For a more established researcher, doing this work could be perceived as applying their existing skills/research to a broader, more impactful context. For a person just starting out like myself, it can feel like the research topic I am pursuing defines my research identity and career steps very strongly (despite not quite being what I want to study long term). Education & mindset intervention research is fairly established as a field and might be perceived in some way? I do want to do impactful research but I want fundamental training and "establishment" in some way first. When I am asked to describe my research interests and current work, it is hard to explain how it applies to (computational) cognitive science. In many ways, I didn't really think that much about what I was getting into when I decided to start doing this research -- I mostly wanted to gain skills in communication, figure out a more clear research direction, and become more "independent." I was and am so glad to have this opportunity but it feels like it is taking me further away from my original goals (most presentations and talks are about this main project so it feels like I'm presenting myself in this way). I didn't actually set out to study learning but rather broadly visual reasoning and my current project with mindset interventions is quite different from that plan (despite very much more "visual" topics existing within education/ stats literacy research including with graphs/visualizations). I have been part of other projects (sketching, games) but it is mostly as a supporting role. *(More probably on this later ... something about mechanistic models as opposed to descriptive models)*

Basically, the problem really isn't with this research topic at all but how it aligns with my goals and self-presentation. I feel constrained/in a crisis because it feels like betrayal either way and I also don't have much power/control with this.

*edit (02/17):* 
* It is hard to describe my current research because it doesn't feel like it fully represents what I want to do in the future (I do talk about it but it feels a bit odd). This work is incredibly important and should be part of cocosci, but at the same time, it is very well established in another field and people (both in and out of academia) tend to have lots of existing perceptions about "growth mindset."

### visual reasoning 
*section name might be changed ...*
* Why do I care about visual reasoning? There is some kind of pipeline here (see below). I spent all of college thinking about vision (engaged with primate vision, computer vision, human perceptual vision & physical reasoning) -- it wasn't because it was simply there and easy to access. I am simply fascinated by the fact that so much of how we interact with anything is through intaking visual information (even if it is reading text or observing facial expressions). I enjoy creating experiments/stimuli that are visually interesting/aesthetic/etc. probably because I spent so much of my life thinking about art and design + it can really affect the experiment process. [Illusions](https://michaelbach.de/ot/) are so interesting because they diverge from expectations and expose limits of perception which we take for granted -- they can also be really interesting artistically. I do think I can give an interesting perspective on this research given my experiences (drawing/doodling since childhood with different mediums, formal lessons/training, worked on art/creativity/community spaces on an institutional level). 
* Vision is a well established field yet there is still so much we don't know. How much of our experiences are perceptually driven while others are more top-down? How do our visual systems enable us to ["glean"](./3_02-16-2025.md#gleaning) critical information and draw countless inferences? How do our decisions/actions change when we have to take into consideration other people's (visual?) decoding/interpretation processes? I like how "low-level" perception is heavily "concrete" and constrained (extremely precise experiences and very clear mechanistic models -- CNNs, Gabor filters, etc). However, I don't know if I could spend a lifetime working on very simplistic, precise, lab tasks while knowing humans are extremely complex and affected by higher level cognition (the experiments are also more interesting to me here). I mostly have experience with the visual input side but I really enjoy visualization research (including J.F., A.V.) for how it delves into visual outputs aka using graphics to communicate. I wouldn't really want to study it from the purely HCI lens though. 
* I'll write some separate thoughts about [language]() (spoken and written) & [mental health]() (states?) in the future. I am interested in them but somehow I could not imagine **only** studying them while I could imagine only studying visual topics. It would be really cool to combine them with visual-ish things though. 
* I could imagine some world where mindset interventions does intersect but have to think a bit more on this. **How do our experiences and the (situational/cultural) context affect our processing/reasoning?** This part could tie in to education and creative processes (writing/design/etc).

### computational cognitive science 

What led me here? I will say that I have always been interested in people, what they think about, and why they are the way that they are. A "mathy" background and undergrad institution led me to computer science (also the power and freedom programming gives for everything including creation). I initially wanted to study the brain but didn't quite know what area (not cellular molecular level or web lab things though). 

* The actual road to cognitive science was really a sort of natural (accidental) progression from working in BCS where many of my mentors crossed the bridge between neuroscience and cognitive science. I was working on a primate vision model project with two post-docs and one left for a faculty job. I ended up continuing to do research with the other post-doc which led me to the vision science of intuitive physics, and naturally, cognitive science. 
* I did have some doubts at first about cognitive science (not the part of wanting to develop computational models though) because a lot of the studies (and models) I encountered then were very behavioral. I wondered if the models ( bayesian) could even generalize to comprehensively represent a mind. It wasn't possible to fully understand every single underlying process -- as opposed to a shallow NN where different layers could represent different steps in the visual system. (This is a bit sounding like my issue with [ed. research](#ed-research) which is that it feels too high level + noisy + the models don't feel satisfying and (neurally/human) aligned.)
* I did eventually really grow to enjoy and identify with cognitive science. The experiments are sometimes [games](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01878-9) which are fun to design and analyze. It is also cool to draw cognitions between different "levels" of the brain (various fmri studies with physics simulations, see work from [R.T. Pramod](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=w1XHczsAAAAJ) and [visual processing of non-rigid materials](http://cncl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/pub-downloads/SfN23_cloth%20%281%29.pdf)). I like the flexibility and creativity in methods as well as the breadth of topics in the field. 
* I don't envision a world where I do anything at this stage in my life. I am able to work on a variety of tasks (which was why I found software engineering a bit less appealing) and can sort of connect to all topics I'm interested in.  -->

## existential crises

I am overthinking again about the future and applications ... How do I present myself as a researcher and what do I actually care about? How do I even put into words what I care about? Does it even matter what I care about (should it even matter to me)? 

*edit (02/17): not even only as applied to research and career haha*

<!-- * The science more than the application (which is still very important!!)
* Something visual & sort of design/creative (maybe there is a way to make math games fun)
* highly engineered models to help “turn the knobs” as E.B. would say → know very clearly how things are done and how components relate
* humans and their brains/minds are a priority! (compared to machines, purely behavioral measures) -->
