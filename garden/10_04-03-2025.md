## trains and subways

<!-- *“You’re waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can’t be sure.” – Mal, Inception (2010)* -->

Waiting for something to take us to our destination, together and alone. 

*more, soon*

## bikes

My life is a collection of bike rides. 

Sitting on my grandfather's bike in [china](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China). Learning on training wheels near the sidewalk of my [childhood home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan). Falling onto concrete and gathering scars (including ones I hid from my parents). Balancing with a totebag on one shoulder while riding to piano class. Riding the bike to the library in the summer. Biking the circumference of [mackinac island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_Island) (the entire island is < 4.5 sq. mi. and cars are banned). Biking to lab in the summer. Falling and taking a break from biking. M.N. taking me blue biking spring of freshmen year (very rusty). Bluebiking around [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston) in the summer. Renewing my subscription for years. Biking to class (always totebag). Biking to [cookcrew](https://dh.mit.edu/faqs/1/) and getting last minute ingredients from [central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Square%2C_Cambridge). Biking from [commonwealth ave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Avenue_(Boston)) to lab. Biking with G.Z. during [NY Summer Streets](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/summerstreets.shtml) and electric biking to [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn). Buying a bike after moving to the [bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area). Biking home from work. Biking home with bags on both shoulders. Biking with R.W. at [shoreline park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreline_Park_(Mountain_View,_California)). Reuniting with V.S. who finished [biking across the country](https://mitspokes.com/). Increasingly unable to use the bike. Buying another bike months later and A.L. fixing it. Biking is hard again because the front brake came loose.
