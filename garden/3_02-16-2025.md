## creating
*04/16/2025*
1) Following a Bob Ross tutorial to try to get over a sense of perfectionism in art ... but they are really meant for traditional art and the painting techniques are difficult to implement with procreate. 
2) I did make a nice drawing though! It references carnations and fish featured in old drawings. It is *the beginning* of creating again. (P.S. the person in the drawing is from pinterest!)

* I won't put every drawing on here but I drew while watching [Chungking Express](./1_02-15-2025.md#1-about-love-stories-automation-and-writing). It was eye opening to capture dynamic and designed scenes (intentional / stylistic choices in the directing and editing process). I seem to have found patterns that persisted throughout the movie: fish, fish tanks, gaze, wall splitting frames, sitting postures, etc. It is very freeing capturing the essence and mood of the story rather than any individual scene's likeness. 

## gleaning

It is sort of interesting to define what *gleaning* is and how it differs from foraging, harvesting, etc. These are my meanings but I'm sure there are more "official" ones. They can all be applied to the physical or digital world. 

**harvesting** includes receiving and selecting the fruits of something personally grown and nutured. 

**foraging** is to parse something that is in the "wild" (perhaps created by nature or raw inputs) rather than intentionally curated by another human. 

**gleaning** is gathering the bits and scraps of something created by another and possibly using it for something it wasn't meant to be used. Urban gleaning refers to gathering in cities (constructed spaces), where things may have been developed for one person/goal only but can be reloved again others.

- to care for deeply and have patience to wait for something small to grow and flourish 
- to love and respect what is there and not change how it got there 
- to gaze upon something and see all its past and futures  -->

## learning 

*coming soon!*

## adulthood 

What does it mean to be an adult? It doesn't seem to be becoming a stable system but rather like a "control system" (cybernetics, from A.Z.) where we learn to regulate ourselves with respect to internal and external changes.
