## creating
*04/16/2025*
1) Following a Bob Ross tutorial to try to get over a sense of perfectionism in art ... jk they are really meant for traditional art and the painting techniques are difficult to implement with procreate. 
2) I did make a nice drawing though! It references carnations and fish featured in old drawings. It is *the beginning* of creating again. (P.S. the person in the drawing is from pinterest!)

* I won't put everything on here but I sketched while watching [Chungking Express](./1_02-15-2025.md#1-about-love-stories-automation-and-writing). It was eye opening in many ways to capture dynamic and designed scenes (intentionally or stylistically kept in the directing and editing process). I seem to have found patterns that persisted throughout the movie: fish, fish tanks, gaze, wall dividing scenes, sitting postures, etc. It is very freeing to not care so much about about the quality of the sketching but rather capturing the essence and mood of the story. 

## gleaning

It is sort of interesting to define what *gleaning* is and how it differs from foraging, harvesting, etc. These are my meanings but I'm sure there are more "official" ones.  

**harvesting** includes receiving and selecting the fruits of something personally grown and nutured. 

**foraging** is to parse something that is in the "wild" (perhaps created by nature or raw inputs) rather than intentionally pre-curated by another human. 

**gleaning** is gathering the bits and scraps of something created by another and possibly using it for something it wasn't meant to be used. Urban gleaning refers to gathering in cities, where things may have been developed for one thing but post utility, they are reloved. 

Related thoughts: 
- to care for deeply and have patience to wait for something small to grow and flourish 
- to love and respect what is there and not change how it got there 
- to gaze upon something and see all its past and futures 

## learning 

*coming soon!*

## adulthood 

What does it mean to be an adult? It doesn't seem to be becoming a stable system but rather like a "control system" (cybernetics, from A.Z.) where we learn to regulate ourselves with respect to internal and external changes.
