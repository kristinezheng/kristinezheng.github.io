## dynamical systems

[Growing](./3_02-16-2025.md#adulthood) is a nebulous concept. I am considering my personal growth this year to try to include the following (not exclusively):

* exploring interests and hobbies
* acquiring taste: [1](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224), [2](https://behavioralscientist.org/how-to-cultivate-taste-in-the-age-of-algorithms/)
* communicating boundaries (social battery, time, resting)
* figuring out identity in all aspects (may or may not intersect with interests and other bullet points)
* leaving comfort zones <!-- choosing to speak my mind, think a lot and do *hard* things  -->
* wanting [less](https://whateverhappened.substack.com/p/stop-trying-to-curate-everything) and more at the same time 
* living [truly](https://substack.com/@celinenguyen/p-151401647) in the present with [chaos](https://substack.com/home/post/p-157019622?selection=3c403c4e-38ac-468d-9cd1-90bcf2ef5f5e) and serendipity
* thinking more about love, vulnerability, and [intimacy](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/essay-interracial-love/) 
* balancing consumption with creation

## in defense of futility, frivolousness, and fearlessness   

*more, soon*
<!-- As time passes, the things we pursue seem to increasingly have to be justified. We might even feel pressure to become "good" at hobbies or provide "deep" insights about our favorite books and movies.  -->

<!-- What does it cost? -->
