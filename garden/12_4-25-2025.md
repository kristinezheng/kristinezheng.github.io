## imperfection

I like for (near) everything to have a bit of imperfection, perhaps marred by human touch (probabilistically). White sneakers look a bit better when they are worn and scruffy. Music is more emotonal in its acoustic version or when artists sing live. Photos captured from film cameras have a graininess or extreme coloration that photo editing might try to mimic. 
<!-- Podcasts are intimate and recordings are noisy (L.W.). -->

Something too new, too constructed, and too polished doesn't have the same story to tell (reveals little about its creators and users). 

Perfection can feel too intentional and effortful (opposite of sprezzatura !) yet somehow also bland and robotic (artifically generated). 

To some degree, extractions of the real world to movies, animations, and drawings also feel more compelling when they have unique lighting and painterly styles. Realism in recent animated movies (think clothing animated on the fiber level) feels more like a flex of graphics advancement than any benefit to the content. Arcane, into the Spider-Verse, and puss in boots: the last wish instead all have a mix of painterly 2D styles on 3D elements that draws us in visually while enhancing the actual story.
