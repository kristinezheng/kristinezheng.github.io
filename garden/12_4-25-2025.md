## imperfection

I like for (near) everything to have a bit of imperfection, perhaps marred by human touch. White sneakers look a bit better when they are worn and scruffy. Music is more emotonal in its acoustic version or when artists sing live. Photos captured from film cameras have a graininess or extreme coloration that photo editing might try to mimic. 
<!-- Podcasts are intimate and recordings are noisy (L.W.). -->

Something too new, too constructed, and too polished doesn't have the same story to tell (reveals little about its creators and users). 

Perfection can feel too intentional and effortful (opposite of sprezzatura !) yet somehow also bland and robotic (artifically generated). 

To some degree, extractions of the real world to movies and animations also feel better when they have unique lighting and painterly shots.
