# #7 The garden 

What do gardens mean to me? 

Much of my childhood was spent outdoors, either playing in parks and forests or following my father into garden patches. 

My father is a hard man for me to understand. As far as I know, he has always been intensely obsessive about math and his academic work but was born into a farm family (my grandparents moved more into a city I think?). Despite his sort of hermit working habits, we have always had a garden. 

In my earliest memories, we lived in a subsidized townhouse and my grandparents would sometimes visit to take care of us while my parents worked. We  had the smallest amount of land (probably less than 15 sq ft.?) and somehow my father rotated growing tomatoes, cucumbers, chinese chives, and pumpkin.
