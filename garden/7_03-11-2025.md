# #7 The garden 

What do gardens mean to me? 

Much of my childhood was spent outdoors, either playing in parks and forests or following my father into garden patches. 

I don't understand my father. From my earliest memories, he has always been intensely obsessive about math and his academic work. He was born into an agricultural family and was probably able to pursue the *American* dream through hard work. Despite his work/career habits, we have always had a garden in every place we've lived. 

In my earliest memories, we lived in a townhouse at the edge of town. We had the smallest amount of land (probably less than 15 sq ft.?) and somehow my father rotated growing tomatoes, cucumbers, chinese chives, and pumpkin. I have fond memories of tender pumpkin greens and vine-ripened summer tomatoes in soup. 

The garden followed us to the house we moved into when I was in third grade: an almost cookie-cutter suburban house situated in a cul-de-sac. 

My father loved to talk to the older folks who tended their community gardens, especially the one near my middle school. They liked to exchange tips for growing the strongest plants, countering the cold weather, and keeping away pests (bugs, deer, squirrels, etc).
