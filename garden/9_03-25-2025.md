## a love letter to bitterness

My favorite stand at the farmer’s market is tucked into a bend, probably the second to last on the street. Grant, I believe from our venmo transactions, is typically the dealer at the stand. They sell a number of different vegetables but I beeline towards their mix-and-match greens (actually green, red, and purple) for ten dollars a pound. Mustard, arugula, purslane, mizuna, kale. I love having a variety of greens both in texture and taste. They can be frilly, hearty, crunchy, fleshy, slimy. Many of them taste bitter, sharp, spicy, and even acidic. 

I will be the first to say that I actually dislike most lettuces, especially in salads and sandwiches, because they aren’t very fun or flavorful to eat. Lettuce is a good filler or vessel for other foods but doesn’t do enough for me in most applications. Arugula is typically my favorite because of its nutty and complex flavor (I don’t really find them spicy most of the time) but this mix of greens is the best and goes wonderfully with any sort of mixed bowl meal (with barley, other veg, etc). I’ve also made a nice seasoned banchan-like dish with wilted greens, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Today, I put a handful of the mixed greens in a sandwich with sweet and crisp market apples (borrowed from a roommate), thick slices of dubliner cheese (salty, sort of crumby, and rich), dijon mustard (salty and spicy), and seedy sourdough. A side of green olives, cornichons, and the remaining apple half rounded out the meal.

I think there is something about the complexity of bitterness and sharpness, especially in condiments, spices, brews, and greens, that I’ve grown to savor more and more. Sweet, creamy, or bland foods are still appealing but sometimes they can be a bit queasy and boring. In Spain, my sister and I did a sort of hopping on the last day; we found some casual bars with ice cold beers and savory bites. We had these really briny gildas: bar skewers with olives, pickled peppers, and anchovies.

I’ve actually never spent over four dollars a time at the greens stand. The greens are fairly light and voluminous. It is truly a small price to pay for the interesting flavors I get in packed lunches and the nutrients the greens probably contain.
